# oeis
A set of tools for studying the well-known Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences

For most of these tools, the executable has to be in the same directory than both [names.gz](https://oeis.org/names.gz) and [stripped.gz](https://oeis.org/stripped.gz).

## oeis-lindep

Look for linear relations between sequences of the OEIS. A regex has to be provided on the command line (at run time) for selecting a set of about 1,000 sequences (eg. "ramanujan" or "graph").
